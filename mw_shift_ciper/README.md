# mw_shift_cipher
## Why this exists
Piggy backing off of the mw_cat program, I wanted to create a less trivial application with the same piping and non-piping functionality.

## Examples of running the program
```
cat src/main.rs | cargo run -- 3
```

```
cargo run -- -1 src/main.rs 
```

```
cargo run -- 3
```
